# Network Segmentation Lab

> **Note:** The subnets and device IP addresses on this page are for demonstration
> only. They are not the ones I actually use. I keep the real addressing out of this
> repo for security reasons.

**Date:** 2026-10-07 to 2026-10-__  
**OS:** pfSense, Netgear GS308EP firmware, TP-Link EAP610 firmware, Raspberry Pi OS  
**Environment:** Homelab  
**Category:** Networking, VLANs, Firewall, DHCP, DNS  
**Status:** In progress

Main repo for this lab is found [here](https://github.com/uploadtigris/network-segmentation-ids).
That repo holds the design. This page is the working log: what I did, in order, and
what broke along the way.

---

## Situation

_What did the network look like before, and why change it?_

- Network before the build (addressing, which devices shared a segment):
- What prompted the build:
- First attempt, July 2026 (what was built, where it stalled):

## Task

Segment the home network into five VLANs with default-deny rules between them,
and prove each rule works from the restricted side.

| VLAN | Name | Subnet | Gateway | Who lives here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mgmt | 10.0.1.0/24 | 10.0.1.1 | Switch (10.0.1.2), AP (10.0.1.3), recovery port |
| 20 | Trusted | 10.0.20.0/24 | 10.0.20.1 | Laptop, phone, PCs |
| 30 | IoT | 10.0.30.0/24 | 10.0.30.1 | Smart devices, hydroponics project |
| 40 | Guest | 10.0.40.0/24 | 10.0.40.1 | Visitors |
| 50 | Servers | 10.0.50.0/24 | 10.0.50.1 | Pi-hole (10.0.50.10), Latitude (10.0.50.20) |

Done when: every row of the test matrix below passes, or the failure is documented.

## Action
